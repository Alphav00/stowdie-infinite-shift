# ⚠️ LEGACY GDD NOTICE

**Date:** January 13, 2026  
**Status:** ARCHIVED - DO NOT USE FOR IMPLEMENTATION

---

## 🔴 Important Notice

The **original 92-page comprehensive GDD** is now considered **LEGACY** and should NOT be used as the source of truth for implementation.

### Why Legacy?

The original GDD was:
- ✅ Excellent for conceptual design
- ✅ Comprehensive in scope
- ❌ Too detailed for rapid iteration
- ❌ Not validated through actual implementation
- ❌ Contains speculative features that may not work on mobile

### Current Source of Truth

**Use these documents instead:**

1. **BUILD_LOGS/** - Actual implemented systems with validated specifications
2. **00_MANIFEST.md** - Current project state and navigation
3. **STOW-AI-BUILD-001.md** - Top screen systems (CURRENT STANDARD)

---

## 📋 Migration Path

If you need information from the legacy GDD:
1. ✅ Check if it's already implemented in BUILD_LOGS/
2. ✅ If not implemented, create a work order to validate it first
3. ✅ Never copy-paste legacy specs without testing on mobile

---

## 🎯 Philosophy Change

**OLD (Legacy):** Design everything upfront, then implement  
**NEW (Current):** Implement, validate, document what actually works

The Living GDD now follows **README-Driven Development**:
- Write specs in BUILD_LOGS based on what exists
- Iterate based on actual mobile testing
- Keep documentation lean and actionable

---

## 📦 What's Actually Built

Refer to:
- **STOW-AI-BUILD-001.md** - Top screen systems (Lyon AI, Aisle scrolling, Player cart)
- Future BUILD logs as systems are completed

---

**If you're looking for design philosophy:** The core concept (Tetris + Alien: Isolation in a warehouse) is still valid.

**If you're looking for technical specs:** Use BUILD_LOGS only.

**Last Updated:** January 13, 2026  
**Reason for Legacy Status:** Moving to iterative, implementation-first documentation
